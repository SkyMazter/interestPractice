                This project was meant to be a easy way to avoid doing repetative math on a sheet of paper.
                <br>
                You must start by entering a value into the input field below, this will serve as the initial value that you invest,
                which would be $5000 in the case of the practice sheet assigned. 
                <br>
                Based on the value entered, the function will determine how long it wil take for your initial value to reach $1,000,000 USD
                in terms of years.
                <br>
                The result will be based on a yearly compounded interest of 12%, assuming that the percentage remains constant and that 
                every year you keep investing the same amount of money as the initial value. 
                <br>
                Do not input any special symbols such as "# $ ? . , % * or &" along with letters into the input field
                <br>
                Note: All values given from this site are not exact, these are just rough estimates based on educated guesses and simple math.
